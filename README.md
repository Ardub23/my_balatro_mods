A collection of mods made by me for Balatro.
# 5 legendary challenges: Adds 5 challenges, each featuring a legendary joker.
- Destroyer: With eternal caino, pareidolia and sixth sense, you need to acquire and destroy 6s to get multi.
- Gotta Go Fast: Begin with triboulet, but the required score scales extremely fast.
- Bankrupt: Begin with $100 and yorick, but each discard costs $10, so eventually you'll go bankrupt.
- Anti-Medusa: The deck is full of stones, and the only way to unpetrify cards is the empress generated by perkeo.
- Overpowered Boss: All boss blinds halve your base chips and multi, and the only source of money is matador. There is a soul card with chicot in it, so when to use?

# Betmma Jokers: Adds 5 jokers.
- JJookkeerr: Jokers with the word "Joker" in their names each gives X1.5 Mult.
- Ascension: Increase the tier of played joker hand by 1. e.g. High Card counts as One Pair. 
- Hasty Joker: Earn $8 if round ends after first hand.
- ERRORR: Discarded cards have 1 in 3 chance to become random rank.
- Piggy Bank: Put half of earned dollars into it and gain 1 Mult for each dollar.
- Also adds a challenge beginning with these 5 jokers to test them.

# Betmma Vouchers: Adds 12 vouchers.
- Oversupply: Gain 1 Voucher Tag after beating boss blind.
- Oversupply plus: Gain 1 Voucher Tag after beating every blind.
- Gold Coin: Gain $25 immediately. Small Blind gives no reward money. (Yes it literally does nothing bad after white stake)
